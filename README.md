# Aagam Sogani — SWE & AI SWE Intern Candidate

I build practical ML + backend systems that ship: recommendation engines, CV-powered educational tools, and developer productivity bots. I like small teams, fast iteration, and measurable impact.

## Highlights
- 🧪 **NSF-funded research @ MAGIC Lab (UW–Madison)** — co-built an embodied-learning game (**THVO**) with a webcam pose pipeline; **30+ students** used it in pilot; **2+ GB** of pose data collected for study.
- 🧠 **AI Recommendation Engine** — PyTorch + Flask collaborative filtering with offline eval (MAP@K/NDCG) and a REST API.
- 🤖 **Developer Support Chatbot** — retrieval-augmented Q&A that answers “how do I…?” questions about a codebase.

**Interests:** ML systems · Recommenders · Computer Vision · Human-in-the-loop tooling  
**Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Flask/FastAPI, OpenCV/MediaPipe, NumPy/Pandas, Postgres, Docker, GitHub Actions

## Selected Projects

### [THVO Educational Game — MAGIC Lab (NSF)](https://github.com/asogani23/MAGIC-lab-thvo-summary)
**Role:** SWE / CV support  
**Impact:** classroom pilot with **30+** middle-schoolers; **2+ GB** pose data logged  
**What I did:** gameplay logic; Flask services (levels/saves/logging); UI flows; pose-matching validation (MediaPipe/OpenCV); playtesting & data collection.  
*Repo is a case study; code private.*

### [AI Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/asogani23/AI-Recommendation-Engine)
Production-style collaborative filtering service (PyTorch) with REST API, offline metrics (MAP@K, NDCG), Docker, and CI.

### [Developer Support Chatbot](https://github.com/asogani23/Developer-Support-Chatbot)
RAG assistant for repo/docs. Ingests markdown + code, retrieves relevant chunks, and answers with citations. Includes an evaluation harness.
